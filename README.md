# Ease Elves: Ease your mind with a trustworthy elf! üßù

3rd Place Prize at the DEVS Hackathon 2024 following the theme 'Hack for Humanity'

A step up from your notes app, Ease Elves provides a visualized interpretation of someone to talk to when you feel like you can't speak to anyone else. Elves can serve as a visual reminder that worries are acknowledged and, in a way, being managed. We chose this approach to tackle mental health as studies show that venting your feelings can relieve stress and positively impact your wellbeing. Statistics indicate that the more wellbeing activities you adopt, the higher your wellbeing score.
